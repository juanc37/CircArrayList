/**
 * An array-based priority queue implementation.
 * <p>
 * A first-in-first-out (FIFO) data container, the basic queue represents
 * a line arranged in the order the items arrive. This queue differs from
 * the standard implementation in that it requires all enclosed objects
 * support comparison with like-type objects (Comparable), and it
 * automatically arranges the items in the queue based upon their ranking.
 * Lower items appear closer to the queue's front than larger items.
 * </p>
 * Due to their nature, queues must support rapid enqueue (offer) and
 * dequeue (poll) operations. That is, getting in and out of line must
 * occur rapidly. In this priority queue, the poll operation shall occur
 * in constant time, but because the queue requires arrangement, adding
 * to the circular-array based priority queue may produce slower timings,
 * for the data structure must use binary-search to locate where the new
 * item belongs in relation to everything else, and it must then shift
 * the existing contents over to make room for the addition.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the likely event two objects share the same priority, new items
 * added to the queue shall appear after existing entries. When a standard
 * priority customer enters the line, it should naturally go behind the
 * last standard customer currently in line.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Although technically a Collection object, the queue does not support
 * most of the standard Collection operations. That is, one may not add
 * or remove from the Queue using the collection methods, for it breaks
 * the abstraction. One may, however, use a Queue object as an input
 * parameter to any other Collection object constructor.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <E> Object to store in container. It must support comparisons with
 *            other objects of the same type.
